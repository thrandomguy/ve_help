          <p>We have received a large donation this month, you can check the address bellow to see the amount. This will help hundreds of families but it'll take us time to coordinate the help and process all of the money. So please do not donate anymore at the moment, once we have properly processed this donation; images, videos and details will be uploaded here on the website, this message will be removed and donations reopened. We weren't ready to coordinate such a big amount of help as we were just a small operation run by 2 guys, but we're coordinating as of now.</p>
          
          <p>We partenered with a few churches of different religions so they could do a record on people in need of food and medicine, both people that attend their churches and people that don't of course, we hope through word of mouth everyone will hear about it and know where to go, once this is done completely we'll proceed to set up baskets of food for each of these persons that should last them for a whole month, same with medicine, this will continue for as long as the money lasts.</p>
          
          <p>Note: Nothing will be imported, everything will be bought directly here, we're also only operating in our state and won't be able to move supplies to other states due to quite a lot of risks that moving cross state could bring to us or to our supplies.</p>

          <p class="font-weight-bold text-danger">I had to think this for a long time, but here is what i have decided to do:</p>
          
          <p class="font-weight-bold text-danger">Due to the huge risk factor i have decided to cancel this project, i had to notify the institutions i was going to work with that i no longer was able to provide what i initially said i would.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold text-danger">A lot of people warned me against doing this, and i became specifically afraid of the high interest this brought onto me, my reddit account is anonymous, but if i completed the project it would become clear what my real identity is both by posting pictures/videos online on the website and on my reddit profile and people comparing them to other pictures that would be posted online by third parties, they would easily find out who i am by asking around, this is a fact because the project was big enough to involve thousands of people thus everyone would be talking about it once completed and pictures and videos would be taken all over the place and shared everywhere by everyone.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold text-danger">I don't want that risk, thugs easily kill other people for less than $10 in this country, and since i care a lot about myself and my family i sadly won't take that risk even if it means not helping thousands of people.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold text-danger">The donation has been refunded back to reddit.com/user/deannolan, he has been notified, and he understood. </p>

<p class="font-weight-bold text-danger">I will continue to provide help on a small scale from time to time, but won't do anything big enough that would draw even the tiniest bit of attention towards me.</p>

<p>
The Venezuela of 20 years ago was filled with smiling and happy people all around the
country, the minimum monthly salary was around $600 and with that you could buy anything
you needed to sustain yourself and your family, providing clothing, computers, shoes, toys,
vacations, houses, cars, we could afford anything.
</p>
<p>
Today however minimum wage is around $4.7 as of the moment, and this goes lower and
lower every week because of the huge inflation this country is going through, even when
minimum wage is increased in our currency (vef) every few months. It’s right now sitting at
450’000VEF monthly, and each USD equals to 95500VEF right now (Back in the year 2000
one USD was equal to 0.570VEF.
</p>
<p>
You can check USD and VEF relation by date at this website <a href="https://dolartoday.com/indicadores/">https://dolartoday.com/indicadores/</a> just
scroll down to the first chart, click it and download the document.

You can check a daily updated list of prices at <a href="https://twitter.com/AltoPreciosVzla">https://twitter.com/AltoPreciosVzla</a> (They are
also displayed in terms of USD)
</p>
<p>
and the list goes on, rice, pastas, toothpaste, veggies, fruits…</p>
<p>
With a minimum monthly salary (that’s about 35 hours of work every week for a whole
month) being 450’000VEF, people that live on minimum salary are only eating once a day,
and they are not even eating fully nutritional meals. Those who also have a family that they
need to sustain are going through worse times as they have to stretch those 450’000VEF to
feed 2 or 3 people instead of just one.</p>
<p>
Most people are not eating meat more than only once a week, some people go a whole day
without eating. A lot of people are sorting through the trash bins behind markets and
restaurants scavenging for foot that they can take back home to their families.
Kids are going to school without breakfast and they return home over 7 hours later after
class without eating anything for the whole day because a lot of public schools are not
serving lunches any more due to lack of funding.</p>
<p>
Public government funded places for the elderly where they are supposed to spend their last
few years of life without worries after having worked hard during their youth are not being
funded anymore, so now they are receiving donations from other people in order to be able
to provide basic needs for the elderly who live there most of which don’t have families to get
them out of there or help them in any way. They are not even receiving the medicine that
they need to keep the pain of being old away.</p>
<p>
Regular people are constantly asking for help to get the medicine that they need, it is really
heartbreaking and unbelievable but people are dying of preventable diseases because they
can’t afford medicine, even small diseases. And big ones like cancer are a death sentence
no matter how early it’s detected as equipment to treat it is almost non existent and where it
exists the treatment is extremely expensive.</p>
<p>
As if all of that wasn’t enough, there’s now an epidemic of diphtheria, a disease for which
vaccines have existed for several years and people are dying because they can’t get their
vaccines.</p>
<p>
This Is just a summary of everything that people are going through, there are a lot more
tragedies, like public hospitals running with no funding at all and having to reuse syringes on
the same patients two or three times, not giving proper meals, not having proper equipment
to the point where patients are being laid on the ground as even the beds are broken down,
a huge number of new borns are dying each month because of equipment malfunctions,
power outages, and other reasons, a lot of women giving birth are dying on the beds of the
hospital. </p>
<p>
Giving birth in a public hospital is really risky due to the bad conditions public
hospitals are operating on, but a lot of people can’t pay to give birth in a proper clinic or
private hospital.</p>

<p>
And there are a lot more issues and we’re trying to help as much as we can.</p>

          <p class="">Same applies to schools and elderly places, on public schools kids faint often because their parents can’t properly feed them at home and they often eat once a day, and just eat meat a few times a week, and these schools are not supplying them

          <p class="">









<p>       We started by just serving meals to as many people as we could reach on our own, the
number of meals we were providing was around 50 meals each day. That’s what we could
afford to do at a rate that could keep us going for at least a few weeks.</p>
<p>
Then as more donations started coming we could grow to help people in other ways, back
when we were just providing meals a lot of people had asked us if we could also help them
with medicine that they needed, some others that couldn’t walk had asked us if we could get
them wheelchairs, those who are homeless had asked us if we could provide clean clothes,
toilet paper, soaps, sheets and pillows...</p>
<p>
So we started to further help people by providing medicine, clean clothes, shoes, soaps,
toilet papers and so far 3 wheelchairs that we could purchase second hand at a good price
but that were in perfect condition. We also started to provide food to a few churches that also
serve meals for free everyday as well as providing a weekly supply of food for an elderly
institution in our town which hosts 80 people.</p>
<p>
 There’s a lot of room to go further and help a
lot more people, in times when even working hard won’t allow you to eat more than once a
day, everyone needs help. The streets are full of people begging for anyone to help them, to
give them food because they are starving, to give them medicine that they need, kids asking
you to help them with some food because his family at home haven’t eating for the whole
day.</p>
<p>
Parents having to watch their kids lose their health and not being able to do anything at all
no matter how hard they try.</p>

          <p class="">My name is Richard and i live in Acarigua - Portuguesa, i'm working on this project with my best friend, his name is Jhon. We're both under 30 years old and professionals, i'm an engineer and he's a teacher.</p>
          <p>
            Due to quite a lot of concerns to our safety if the wrong people found out who we are in real life we could be targeted by thugs who would kill us or threaten to kill our family to get our money, specially since through my reddit profile people can find out that i'm a web developer and i have a decent salary in USD. Even by reading about bitcoin on my profile they are dumb enough to think that since each is worth over $15k then they'd think i have hundreds or thousands of bitcoins, they are silly like that.
            </p>
            <!--
            <p>

            However to talk a little more about myself, i was born here, my mother and my mothers family came here in the 70s from Portugal when Venezuela offered a huge amount of opportunities, my dad was Venezuelan to the bone, he was born here and all of his known ancesters as well, he loved everything about this country and said he would never leave this place, he also helped a lot of people throughout his life, he was humble and a great guy and always put family first before him, and before anything else, he would go to great lenghts to make sure we all were always doing great.
            </p>
            <p>

            My moms family opened a couple of business here when they arrived in the 70s, sadly due to a lot of bad luck like my grandad being too old and weak to be able to pay attention to everything back then the places didn't succeed. My moms family, the ones who came here were her mom, her dad (my grandma and grandpa), my mom, and 4 sisters (my aunts). Sadly now only my mom and one of my aunts are left and the rest passed away due to different health difficulties.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have a degree in Telecommunications engineering, though focused more in digital programming (it is where software and electronics meet). However for about 3 years now i have been working as a web developer because that's the easiest way to make money from the internet finding clients from other countries to hire me for projects. And since i was completely sure i would never be able to sustain my family by working for someone in the country due to salaries being too low i picked that career path, and that's what i'm doing today, i can sustain my family, save and put a little towards helping other people as well.
            </p>
            <p>

            I grew up with video games and i loved languages as well because my grandma never learnt spanish so i grew up speaking portuguese with her and spanish with everyone else (sadly since i haven't spoken portuguese for many years i lost practice and can't speak much anymore), at some point when i was under 10 years old i picked a pocket english-spanish and walked around with it all day looking through things i saw everywhere on my way to learn how they were spelled in english. That's basically how i learn to speak it.
          </p>
        -->
            <p>

            I love my people, or at least i love all of the people that i have met and interacted with throughout my life as i was growing up, Venezuelans tend to be very warm and kind people it doesn't matter if you're their family member, their friend or just a stranger. They will help you and be kind to you without expecting anything back from you. It's sad that good. selfless people like these; who won't think about themselves first, who won't care about not sleeping much and working a lot as long as that helps their families to be doing a little better, it's not fair people like this are going through what they are going right now.

            crime, so we really have to take care of ourselves as it is a really sensible situation.

          <h1 class="text-center text-danger">WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING TO?</h1>
          <p class="">100% of the donations are going towards helping the people, neither me nor my friend take any amount of money from the donations. </p>
          <p>This is a non-profit. I have mentioned it before and you can verify it by checking my reddit profile, i work as a web developer freelancing online, i work for clients all over the world and i charge according to international markets, because of this i can sustain my family and myself without troubles and i also have spare money from my work after monthly expenses to put towards my savings.
          </p>
          <p>In the past i used to use part of my own money to help the people, that was, of course, in a smaller scale because i only had so much of my own money to put aside towards this, then after i started to receive donations the operations grew and reach quite a lot more people today.</p>
          <p>Because i love what i do professionally wise, i love working in order to keep growing professionally, specially learning everyday. I am required to put 8 hours  a day towards my job (that's a timeframe i set myself of course as freelancers are their bosses), then also taking out another 10 hours towards sleep and other activities there are about 8 hours left on each day free to dedicate towards this cause, we're currently spending about 4 hours a day maximum on the cause. </p>

          <h1 class="text-center text-danger">HOW ARE TX FEES DEALT WITH?</h1>
          <p class="">They are not a problem. I keep chunks of a few hundred dollars on localbitcoins and sell the bitcoins slowly as supplies run out, i have to do so as slowly as possible because otherwise if i convert bitcoin to my currency and let that money sit for too long it'll get crushed by our inflation. </p>
          <p>Basically when the amount in localbitcoins is almost empty i send a few more hundred dollars in bitcoins to localbitcoins with a low fee of about 22sat/byte. Which won't be an issue if it takes some time to confirm. As there will still be funds in localbitcoins.</p>
